Version 1.0 Final
=================

- First public release of the module.

Version 1.01
------------

* Remove unused reference to Catalogue module in /class/archive.php (sato-san)

Version 1.1
-----------

* Updated to comply with ImpressCMS 1.3/2.0 specification (no longer compatible with 1.2).

Version 1.11
------------
* Fix slow index page load when gzip enabled on ICMS 1.3.2.

Version 2.0 BETA (29/7/2012)
----------------------------
* Added support for module-specific category trees. Modules can now use Sprockets to maintain their 
own independent category tree. See Contact V1.04 or Library_ipf V1.0 for examples of integration.

* NB: This breaks compatibility of Sprockets with other client modules; however the fixes required 
to restore functionality are minor and updates for all client modules will be issued together with
the final version of Sprockets 2.

Version 2.0 final (15/1/2013)
-----------------------------
- Improve handling of recent content block (number of results returned still leaves a bit to be 
desired).
- Disabled spotlight function of recent content block. To be revisited in a future version.
